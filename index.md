The European Registry of Materials is a simple registry with the sole purpose to mint material
identifiers to be used by research projects throughout the life cycle of their project. The
identifier is nothing more than that identifier, and not by default linked to any information.
Think of it as a pre-registration of the intention to study the material.

More information is provided in this [README](https://github.com/NanoCommons/identifiers/blob/master/readme.md).

## How to register new materials

The process to register new materials is described in [this document](register.md) and
[J. van Rijn et al.](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-022-00614-7).

## How to use the identifier

The identifier is supposed to be use in all written material. The identfier will be a simple
identifier starting with "ERM". It is recommended to use the identifier in the
[Compact Identifier](https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5944906) form
([identifiers.org entry](https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/erm))

### Use in semantic web solutions

For use in semantic web approaches, an equivalent IRI version is available with prefixes the
short identifier with "https://nanocommons.github.io/identifiers/registry#".
